EMA (Exponential Moving Average)The 12-day EMA is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.Bullish: Price > EMABearish: Price < EMA2. Hurst Exponent ($H$)The Hurst Exponent is used to determine the "memory" of a stock's price action:$H > 0.5$ (Trending): The stock is likely to continue in its current direction.$H < 0.5$ (Mean Reverting): The stock is likely to reverse toward its average.$H = 0.5$ (Random Walk): The price movement is completely random.🖥️ UsageAdd Stocks: Use the sidebar to add tickers to your watchlist.Analyze: Click on a ticker to fetch the last 30 days of price data and the last 24 hours of news.Sentiment: View the color-coded sentiment badges (Green = Bullish, Red = Bearish) to gauge market mood.⚠️ TroubleshootingENOSPC (No Space Left on Device):If you encounter this error during npm install, it means your hard drive is full.
